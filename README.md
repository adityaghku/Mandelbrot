# Mandelbrot

This is a simple project in Python that plots the Mandelbrot set on the complex plane with some coloured visualisations.
The function fullMandelbrot can be called with parameters 'dimensions' passed as an integer and 'cmap' passed as a string. 
They determine the size and visuals of the image respectively. A cmap can be chose from the matplotlib library. 

More updates will follow, including the Julia set, zooming functionality, and an interactive GUI.
